The project leverages the FlexibleScorer class to score words based on a specified criterion (such as difficulty), and visualizes the results with a horizontal bar plot using matplotlib.\n","\n","## Features\n","- Scoring Words by Difficulty: Each word is assigned a difficulty score using the FlexibleScorer.\n","- Incorporates Definitions: The classifier considers both the word and its definition when calculating difficulty.\n","- Visualization: Generates a horizontal bar chart showing the top 30 words sorted by difficulty.\n","- Output: Saves the results as a CSV file and the bar chart as an image file\n","\n","## Installation\n","To run this project locally, you need to have Python 3.x installed, along with the following dependencies:\n","\n","\n","```\n","pip install pandas matplotlib\n","```\n","\n","Ensure the FlexibleScorer module is available in your Python path.\n","\n","## Sample Output Files\n","- CSV File: The script will output a CSV file containing the words and their corresponding difficulty scores.\n","- Plot Image: The script will also generate an image file with a bar chart displaying the top 30 words by difficulty.\n","\n","# Code\n","## Import
